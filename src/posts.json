Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3\"03' tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they're large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close to this level of compatibility.", "date": "30/05/24 21:12:57", "message_id": "Agd2Ep", "comments": [{"user_id": "NvOnDz", "comment": "nice material for a pokemon movie"}, {"user_id": "1NheqL", "comment": "the most quality post here"}, {"user_id": "eHXHow", "comment": "I'm turned on"}]}, {"user_id": "IXgSbU", "message": "damn it works!! .... the character limit sucks @author", "date": "30/05/24 19:17:59", "message_id": "yeWkmi"}, {"user_id": "r2qIxZ", "message": "Hello helooo hellooooooo.

You get all sorts of viewpoints, not just what those big companies push. People here talk about what's important to them, not just what's on X. It's like a huge playground where everyone's on the same level, and you can speak your mind without stressing. This way, we get to hear all kinds of opinions and stay informed our own way, not just what the big shots want us to hear. This platform surpasses X by far. It enables open and honest communication, free from bias or censorship. Here, everyone's voice holds equal weight, fostering transparent information sharing. In comparison to corporate media, it excels in facilitating genuine conversations.
